      <p class="supporting-main-body-text">
        In Norse mythology, Heimdall was the son of Odin and the Nine Sea Maidens who were daughters of Aegir the Giant
        of the Ocean.
        <br>
        On a beautiful clear day, Odin was wandering along the seashore. There he met the nine beautiful Sea Maidens
        whom he fell for nine of all immediately. Odin decided that he would marry all of them on the spot. And there
        came the marriage between the Allfather and daughters of a giant.
        <br>
        Together they produced Heimdall who later became the Guardsman of Asgard. Legend had it that Heimdall lived with
        his mothers somewhere below Asgard. And only when he fully grew up did he come to Asgard and became the
        Guardsman of Asgard.
        <br>
        The Nine mothers nourished him with the most incredible things. They nourished him with the strength of the
        earth and endurance, the sea's moisture and fluid, the sky's wind, and the freshness and heat of the sun.
        <br>
        These things helped Heimdall grow up rapidly within a short period of time. And when he reached his full
        manhood, he came to Asgard to live among his father and brothers.
